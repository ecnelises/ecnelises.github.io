This is my personal technical blog in English. My progress reports on GSoC will also be shared here. Other posts should normally have a respective Chinese version on my own [wordpress blog](https://blog.ecnelises.com).

I'm currently studying in Tongji University, Shanghai. My interests containing Ruby, compilers and technologies helpful to great products, although I don't have much knowledge now :)

You can email to me at [fwage73@gmail.com](mailto:fwage73@gmail.com), if you'd like to use GPG tools, see my [public key](https://ecnelises.com/mail-public.txt).

This page and blog is powered by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
